# Birthday Quiz Wishes 🎂🎉

A fun and interactive web-based birthday surprise application! This project creates a personalized experience where the birthday person takes a quiz about themselves (or your friendship/relationship) to unlock a final birthday wish or surprise message.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Start Screen**: A welcoming landing page (`index.html`) to begin the experience.
* **Fun Quiz Section**: A JavaScript-powered quiz (`quiz.html`) that checks answers before allowing the user to proceed.
* **Celebratory Finale**: A dedicated final page (`final.html`) to display your heartfelt birthday message, images, or a gift reveal.
* **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `index.html`: The main entry point/welcome screen.
* `quiz.html`: The page containing the quiz questions and logic.
* `final.html`: The destination page after completing the quiz.
* `script.js`: Handles the quiz logic (validating answers, navigation).
* `style.css`: Contains the styling and animations for all pages.
* `img.png` / `img2.png`: Images used for the background or decoration.
